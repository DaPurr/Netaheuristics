# Noptimization

## Description
This crate's intended purpose is to offer a modular framework for popular metaheuristics, while simultaneously offering default modules such that the user only needs to focus on the problem-specific aspects of heuristics design.

Custom modules can be built in order to fit the user's needs.

## Plan
At the least the following heuristics are planned to be implemented:
- Variable Neighborhood Search
- Simulated Annealing
- Large Neighborhood Search

and their adaptive variants
